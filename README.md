# Analyzing Supermarket trends using SQL

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of supermarket operations, leveraging data from 2019. The primary objective of the project is to evaluate sales performance, labor distribution, and operational efficiencies, with a focus on assessing the feasibility of closing stores on Sundays to optimize costs without impacting revenue.

## Project Overview

The analysis begins with an exploration of weekly sales data to identify trends and anomalies. Specific weeks are analyzed in detail to compare revenue generated on working Sundays versus non-working Sundays. Additionally, labor costs are assessed by analyzing the number of employees working during specific periods, identifying opportunities to cut costs by reducing Sunday operations.

## Key Features

1. **Sales Performance Analysis**:
   - Weekly revenue trends are compared for different timeframes to understand the impact of operational changes.
   - SQL queries are used to extract and aggregate sales data for analysis.

2. **Labor Cost Evaluation**:
   - The number of employees working each day is analyzed using operator logs.
   - Potential savings from reduced Sunday operations are estimated, factoring in labor costs.

3. **Operational Insights**:
   - Recommendations are provided for closing stores on Sundays, supported by data-driven evidence.
   - Additional considerations include energy costs, shelf-life goods, and customer shopping behavior adjustments.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: For data manipulation and visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).
- **SQL**: To query and analyze large datasets.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and execute the analysis seamlessly.

## Conclusion

This project provides actionable insights into supermarket operations, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to enhance profitability and operational efficiency. It serves as a template for analyzing retail data to optimize business strategies.
